# Sign Language Classification

## Polish Sign Language
In Poland, the number of deaf people is estimated between 500,000 and 900,000. Each year there are more than 100 people who lose their hearing due to accidents, illness or age.  Members of a linguistic and cultural minority of deaf people call themselves Deaf. The primary language of the Deaf, which is, in a way, a marker of their cultural distinctiveness, is the sign language used in the country. The term sign language is a visual-spatial language, using the sense of sight, used by Deaf parents to communicate with their Deaf children. Polish Sign Language is a completely separate entity, having its own different grammar from Polish. Sign ideographic signs, which are equivalents of words and idioms, form the basis, and are complemented by dactylographic and supplementary signs.

## MediaPipe for sign languages recognition
A solution for hand landmarks detection and tracking is the MediaPipe:
https://developers.google.com/mediapipe

It was used in hand gestures recognition in a few project already, here are few of them:

## Project
The goal of the project is to use a classifier that enables recognition of the sign shown to the device's camera in applications that can then be used for sign language learning, verification and classification of the signs shown.
